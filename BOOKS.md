# Financial Mathematics

* 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 [The (mis) Behavior of Markets](https://amzn.to/49aGpXy) _By Benoit Mandelbrot_(2004)
  One of the best and easy to understand stock market theory books written not by trader, but one of the century's most influential mathematicians! Main point - existing financial math theories based on normal distribution are not good fit for real maket (mis)behaviour. As an inventor of "Fractal Geometry", Mandelbrot claims taht it would be a better tool to describe market behaviour, but gave no ready to use solutions.

* 🔥🔥🔥🔥 [The Mathematics of Financial Derivatives](https://amzn.to/4s0siMc) _By Paul Wilmott, Sam Howison, Jeff Dewynne_

* [Machine Learning for Asset Managers](https://amzn.to/3MysbHj0) _By Marcos M. LŁpez de Prado_
IMHO, very advanced and disconnected set of articles. Requires (at least for me) a lot of preparation and learning

* 🔥🔥🔥🔥 [Option Volatility and Pricing](https://amzn.to/4pBKzO0) _By Sheldon Netenberg_ (2015) 
The bestselling Option Volatility & Pricing has made Sheldon Natenberg a widely recognized authority in the option industry. At firms around the world, the text is often the first book that new professional traders aregiven to learn the trading strategies and risk management techniques required for success in option markets.

* 🔥🔥🔥🔥 [Trading Option Greeks](https://amzn.to/3MCuyc8) _By Dan Passarelli_ (2013)
A top options trader details a practical approach for pricing and trading options in any market condition 
The options market is always changing, and in order to keep up with it you need the greeks―delta, gamma, theta, vega, and rho―which are the best techniques for valuing options and executing trades regardless of market conditions. In the Second Edition of Trading Options Greeks, veteran options trader Dan Pasarelli puts these tools in perspective by offering fresh insights on option trading and valuation.

  IMHO, a lot of similarities with "Option Volatility and Pricing" , but much easy to understand and follow paractical recomendation on spread, stradle, batterfly and other option trading startegies
